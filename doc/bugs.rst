Reporting Bugs
==============

The `degu Launchpad project`_ is where all Degu development is coordinated,
including bug tracking.

If you're using `Ubuntu`_ and have the ``python3-degu`` package installed,
the best way to file a bug is to open a terminal and run::

    ubuntu-bug python3-degu

This will automatically attach useful information to the bug report, which
can greatly help in diagnosing the problem.

Otherwise, please file a bug directly `through the web UI`_.

Also see :doc:`install`.
