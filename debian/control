Description: embedded HTTP server and client library
 Degu is an embedded HTTP server and client library for Python3. It's well
 suited for implementing REST APIs for device-to-device communication on the
 local network.  Degu is being developed as part of the Novacut project.
 .
 Degu includes:
 .
  * A lightweight HTTP server that's easy to embed in desktop and mobile
    applications
  * A low-level HTTP client comparable to the http.client module in the Python3
    standard library
  * IO abstractions and a common parser used by both the server and client
  * Test fixtures that make it easy to create throw-away Degu server
    instances for unit testing
