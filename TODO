Road to Degu 1.0 (or something like that)
=========================================

Definite
--------

    *   Drop *bodies* option from Client and Server.



Likely post Degu 1.0
--------------------

    *   Thus far Degu has focused on "embedding" within applications by running
        the Degu server in a multiprocessing.Process; however, Dmedia will soon
        be running Degu totally in stand-alone script launched via
        subprocess.Popen(); this allows for the Degu server that accepts outside
        connections to be carefully isolated with Apparmor and not share any
        memory space with the main Dmedia process; this is likewise a pattern
        for which Degu should provide a high-level solution, especially for
        security reasons; however, how to capture this in a generic way isn't
        clear at this point.
